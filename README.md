## User stories
* As a skater, I want to find skate parks near my location or discover parks that are new to me.
* As a skater who has found a local skate park, I want to be able to input my current zip code (location) and get directions to the park (all forms of transit)
* As someone who wants to go skating, I want to know what the weather at the location of the skate park
